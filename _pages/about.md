I am a doctoral student in Accounting at the McCombs School of Business, University of Texas at Austin. Prior to returning to school for my PhD, I worked as a CPA for three years at Ernst & Young in Hangzhou, China. I earned my Master's degree in Professional Accountancy at McCombs and my bachelor's degree at Zhejiang University. Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with my husband and three cats.
